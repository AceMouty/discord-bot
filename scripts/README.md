## I don't like magic.

* Do not use third party libraries.
> One should stay away from third party libraries as much as possible.
    Every function in the bot should stick with python's standard library as 
    much as possible - which is always. 

* Security comes first.  
> If using a third party library reduces the risk of implementing it yourself,
    then the use of third party libraries is encouraged.

Besides discord.py, there shouldn't be any other dependencies. 

The point of this bot is to use it as a learning experience. If you are using 
third party libraries, you are learning to cobble together what other people
have done.
