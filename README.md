# Simple, easy to use discord bot

Hyper Kevin is a bot made around [Kevin Powell's community](https://discord.gg/TAdAru). 
The community is CSS first and thus, the bot's features evolve around that. 
Hyper Kevin uses [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
under the hood.

To use the bot locally or on your own server, clone the repo and 
set the TOKEN and SERVER_ID in your environment variables.

```
export TOKEN="your_token_here"
export SERVER_ID=000000000000
```

## Testing the bot 

You can join the server at [Hyper Kevin](https://discord.gg/TtXkVN)

## Note to self: Inviting your bot

* Navigate to [application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* Click on your bot's page
* Go to the "OAuth2" tab
* Tick the "bot" checkbox under "Scopes"
* Tick the permissions required for your bot to function under "Bot permissions"
* Now the resuting url can be used to add the bot to a server. Copy and 
paste the URL into your browser, choose a server to invite the bot to, and
click "Authorize" after having reviewed the permissions.
